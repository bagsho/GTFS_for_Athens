# Introduction

In this document, a validated, frequency-based GTFS feed for Athens, Ohio is created from the current informal transit network files. The final output GTFS feed includes the following files that have the required fields.

-   agency.txt

-   stops.txt

-   routes.txt

-   trips.txt

-   stop_times.txt

-   calendar.txt

-   frequencies.txt

-   shapes.txt

# Import data

## Sample GTFS data format

This feed is a collection of sample data files that are published by Google.

```{r import sample_GTFS, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sample_GTFS <- read_gtfs("data/sample-feed.zip")
```

## Stop & Route data

The webpage links that contain the stop and route data were provided in the beginning of the project. The route data in the hyperlinks in the route page, i.e., <https://ridegobus.com/routes/>, are in pdf format and the address for each stop can be accessed via the hyperlinks in the <https://ridegobus.com/stops/>.

### Scraping the stop addresses

An example information for one particular stop within the links stated above is shown below.

![](data/ohio/akron_station_address.PNG){width="265"}

The following steps explains the process of scraping the addresses of all stops that are provided in the webpage.

First, the links for stops were created.

```{r eval=FALSE}

# stops link
html <- read_html("https://ridegobus.com/stops/")

# get stop names
stop_names <- html %>%
                html_elements(".column-3 a") %>%
                html_text2() %>%
                as_tibble() %>% 
                set_names("stop")

# get stop links
stop_links <- paste0(
                "https://ridegobus.com",
                html %>%
                  html_elements(".column-3 a") %>%
                  html_attr("href") %>%
                  as.character()
              )
```

Then, a function to get stop addresses was created.

```{r eval=FALSE}
get_address <- function(stop_link) {
            address<-read_html(stop_link)%>% 
            html_element(".col-xs-12 :nth-child(1) .col-10 , .col-xs-12 :nth-child(1) strong") %>%     
            html_text2() %>% 
            str_extract_all("(?<=\n).+(?=\n)") %>% 
            pluck(1)
            
            return(address)
}
```

Then, all the stop addresses were scraped from the webpage

```{r eval=FALSE}
stop_addresses<-stop_links %>%  
                  map(get_address) %>% 
                  unlist() %>% 
                  as_tibble() %>% 
                  set_names("address") %>% 
                  bind_cols(stop_names) %>% 
                  relocate(stop)
```

After getting all the addresses, they were converted to coordinates using an open-source geocoding service with **OpenStreetMap** data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
stop_addresses %>%
  geocode(address, method = 'osm', lat = latitude , long = longitude)%>%
  saveRDS("data/lat_longs_missing.RDS")
```

Although most of the coordinates were obtained, the coordinates of some stops couldn't be. Therefore, they were manually found from **Google Maps** one by one and added to the final stop table.

```{r eval=FALSE}

# read lat_longs table that has missing coordinates
lat_longs_missing <- readRDS("data/lat_longs_missing.RDS")

# import missing stops that were previously created manually.
missing_stops <- read_excel("data/missing_stops.xlsx")

# fill the empty missing values from missing stops table
lat_longs <- lat_longs_missing %>%
  left_join(missing_stops, by = "stop") %>%
  mutate(
    latitude = if_else(is.na(latitude), lat, latitude), 
    longitude = if_else(is.na(longitude), lon, longitude)
  ) %>%
  select(-lat, -lon)

# save lat_longs which has no missing coordinates
lat_longs %>% saveRDS("data/stop_coordinates.RDS")
```

### Creating the route data from PDF files

As stated before, the route data on the links are in pdf format. One of the tables in these links are shown below.

![](data/ohio/route_web.PNG)

Therefore, all the tables in these files were copied and pasted to an excel file to be imported later. Some additional information such as direction, stop order, etc. was added since they are needed during the creation of the GTFS files.

### Making the stops information in line with stops data in the route information

After getting the stop and route information from web, it was observed that these two information are not fully compatible with each other, i.e., the addresses of some stops in two documents are not same or close. Therefore, all the addresses and locations were checked manually once again and information for a considerable number of stops was changed. During these efforts, an text based ***stop_id*** field was introduced to prevent confusion caused by stops at different addresses but with the same name. This field is also used in the GTFS files as it is. A snapshot of the resulting stop table in Excel is shown below.

![](data/ohio/stops_excel_file.PNG)

### Import from local file

The route and stop information is put in the same excel file and it was named ***input_file.xlsx***. Now, the only file that is needed for routes and stops information, is this file. Unfortunately, this is not reproducible since the information on the webpage is not compatible with each other.The stops and routes are imported from this file to separate data frames.

```{r import input_file, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
input_stops <- read_excel("data/ohio/input_file.xlsx",sheet = "stops")
input_routes <- read_excel("data/ohio/input_file.xlsx",sheet = "routes")
```
